This is a React native mobile application. This is a basically a small blog
posting app which has just the frontend part. It is not connected to any backend
right now. We are using self defined state management for managing all the states
inside the application. Here one can post a blog, delete and edit the blog.

Update: Now app is running on a ngrok server, but the problem is that for free tier, it will work for only two hour with a given link. We will have to generate a new one each time. The method remains the same, but we get the access of the files/data from a server and those things also gets saved there too. I will also upload the code for server setup that I have done. Tool used is npm json-server.
